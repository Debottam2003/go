In Go (Golang), if two files are in the same package, then:

All unexported (lowercase) and exported (uppercase) identifiers (functions, types, variables, etc.) 
are accessible to each other within that package.

If the package is different then to use identifiers they has to be started with uppercase(exported)
and also the package has to be imported.
